### Description:

Originally I had decided on Hang Man for my final project, but it seemed that was a popular choice, and not challenging enough, so I decided on a more complex game, with many rules and exceptions; something slightly beyond my abilities at the time.

Yahtzee is one of my favourite games of chance, because it also requires good decision making, taking risks or playing safe when necessary. I've both recieved and witnessed insane bouts of luck which flipped the state of entire games depending on just a few rolls of the dice.

Initially for me there were many challenges in implementing a game like Yahtzee. How to display and update the score, how to calculate every column for one to three rolls of five dice, keeping only the last, how to respond to user input, how to factor in Yahtzee's many unique rules, and more.

I learned a lot working on this project, making use of functions I never knew existed. If I were to do this again, and also turn it into a multiplayer game, as it was meant to be, I would use Classes to store and retrieve data from. It would solve some of the problems I had with scoping, too many arguments in my functions, and eliminate unnecessary repetition of code.

If any human is reading this, I would greatly appreciate feedback on any of my work.

This was CS50.
